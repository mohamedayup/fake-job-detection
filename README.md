# fake-job-detection
✨ Innovation  This project introduces an AI-based system that detects fraudulent job offer letters using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Unlike traditional spam detection systems, this model analyzes full offer letters (PDF/Image/Text), extracts text using OCR, and evaluates fraud risk based on linguistic patterns.
